## Using PolySwarm Module

### Scan File

Scanning files requires an open Case, with some files.

Right click the intended file, and click `Scan on PolySwarm`.
This will send the file to PolySwarm where it will be scanned.
Scans take a minimum of 25 seconds, but the delay can increase if PolySwarm is under load.

After the scan completes, a new `Extracted Content` field named `PolySwarm Results` will appear.
You can view details of ther scan there.
Subsequent scans will be reported under the same `PolySwarm Results`, but as a separate result.

Alternatively, you can view the results in the results tab at the bottom of the `Listing` view.

### Hash Lookup

Hash Lookup requires an open Case with some files, that have been hashed.
Specially, it requires an md5 hash to have been generated for the file already.

Right click the intended file, and click `Lookup Hash on PolySwarm` to start a Hash Lookup.
It should complete in a couple of seconds.

The results from a Hash lookup are shown in the same `PolySwarm Results` described above.
If the file has not been seen before by PolySwarm, it will be labeled `Not Found`.

### Rescan File

To scan a file it is uploaded to PolySwarm.
There are many situations where uploading is not feasible. 
In response, we added the rescan option, for files that have been scanned, or have a successful hash lookup from PolySwarm. 
It sends the sha256 and triggers a new scan, all without uploading the file. 

To use rescan, right click the intended file, and click `Recan on PolySwarm`.
This will send the sha256 hash to PolySwarm, where the file will be scanned again, without any upload. 
Scans take a minimum of 25 seconds, but the delay can increase if PolySwarm is under load.

After the scan completes, a new `Extracted Content` field named `PolySwarm Results` will appear.
You can view details of ther scan there.
Subsequent scans will be reported under the same `PolySwarm Results`, but as a separate result.

Alternatively, you can view the results in the results tab at the bottom of the `Listing` view.

## Features

### Right-click options to Scan, Rescan, or Lookup Hash on PolySwarm

When an Autopsy case is open and has ingested files, three new options show up on right clicks: `Scan On PolySwarm` `Rescan on PolySwarm`, and `Hash Lookup on PolySwarm`.

### Custom artifact type

Results from PolySwarm are shown in a new leaf in the tree under `Extracted Content` called `PolySwarm Results`.
Each scan/hash lookup creates new artifact under that heading, so past results are isolated and immutable.

### PolyScoreâ„¢

All scans and hash searches now include the PolyScore.
Find out more about PolyScore on [https://polyswarm.network](https://polyswarm.network).

### Assertions

All assertions are displayed as a list of `author, verdict` pairs.
No more guesswork why PolySwarm in figuring out if a file is malicious.

### Malware Families

Displays a list of malware families that engines have provided with their assertions.

### Tags

Presents tags that PolySwarm has identified to kickstart analysis.

### Known bad

Marks malicious files as `Known Bad` based on PolyScore and Assertion results.

### First Seen

Includes the date this file was first seen by PolySwarm

### Latest Scan
